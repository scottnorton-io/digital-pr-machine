# 📄 Addendum: Content Reuse Rules – *Crossover Strategies & Reformatting Logic*

**Reference Code:** `addendum-content-reuse-rules.md`  
**Purpose:** Provide a structured method to remix and repurpose PickleWhirl content across platforms — without losing voice, momentum, or civic clarity.

Every quote, caption, or reel that worked once… can work three more times — if we reshape it with intention.

This is *not* reposting.  
This is reformatting **with fidelity to the movement.**

## 🔁 Core Principle: *One Post, Three Channels*

**If a post resonates → remix it across:**

| Format        | Channel      | Style Shift                                   |
|---------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Instagram     | Vibe + Visual| Reel, meme, or carousel                       |
| LinkedIn      | Framing      | Civic value, narrative clarity, stat-backed   |
| Email         | Expansion    | Personal tone, behind-the-scenes, founder POV |
| Substack      | Email + Web  | Longform civic story, narrative clarity       |

> High-performing content = **scroll-stopping AND quote-worthy**.  
> Use this crossover logic to make it both.

## 🧩 Signal Loop Anchors for Tagging

Always track reuse by tagging each asset with one or more:

- `#HeatCheck` → Climate and urgency-based framing  
- `#IndoorWhy` → Wellness, access, and belonging narratives  
- `#BuildTheCourts` → Infrastructure and movement messaging  
- `#WhirlLocal` → Player stories and ZIP-based content  
- `#BeginnerForever` → Inclusion, first-timer, skill equity  
- `#ProofNotPitch` → Used in civic decks or funding briefs

## 🧠 Crossover Execution Tips

| Do This...                                              | Not That...                                         |
|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Change tone for audience (email ≠ IG ≠ LinkedIn)         | Don’t repost captions word-for-word                 |
| Emphasize civic insight on LinkedIn                      | Don’t overuse emojis or memes in decks              |
| Reuse structure, not just lines                          | Avoid duplicating visual layout blindly             |
| Schedule across multiple days                            | Don’t flood all platforms same-day with same voice  |
| Localize again (ZIPs, names, temps)                      | Avoid broad generalizations in every reuse          |

## 🔁 Official Reuse Triggers

GPT must auto-suggest reuse when:

- A post is shared 10+ times  
- A city or org quotes or replies  
- A reel has >30% replay rate  
- A quote appears in a deck or council doc  
- A Founding List spike follows a post drop

---

### 📆 Weekly Reuse Rhythm

Every 7 days, remix at least **one asset** — regardless of metric performance — using this cycle:

* **Choose** a caption, reel, or carousel from the last 30 days
* **Remix** into at least 2 additional formats using the crossover table
* **Log** remix in `/analytics/reuse-log.md` under “Weekly Cycle” tag
* **Tag** with `🔁 Remix Ready` and `#ProofNotPitch`

---

### 🧭 Civic Loopback Reuse Rule

If any quote or caption is used in a civic deck (`/crm-board`) or city doc:

* Must be reframed for a public-facing LinkedIn post
* Civic quote must be re-exported to `/scripts` in `.txt` format
* Post must drop within 2 weeks of civic reuse for full loop closure

---

### 🎥 Reel-First Remix Protocol

Any reel with >30% replay or civic reuse must be:

* Translated into a 4–5 panel carousel (`/social-templates/IG/`)
* Civic quote pulled and stored in `/scripts`
* Email snippet created for `/email-drafts`
* Original script stored in `/tv-assets/social-clips/reels/`

This ensures **visual motion becomes civic motion**.

## 🚦 Final Gate: Crossover Checklist

Before reposting or reusing any high-signal content:

- [ ] Is this framed for its new audience?  
- [ ] Does the CTA change with the format?  
- [ ] Is the tone on-brand *and* on-platform?  
- [ ] Have we tagged and logged the reuse?  
- [ ] Is the core message unchanged but newly energized?

## 🎯 Remember

> *We don’t chase reach. We engineer resonance.*  
> Every reuse moment is a chance to prove:  
> **We’re not just posting. We’re moving.**
