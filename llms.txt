## 🧪 Content Integrity Rules
- All content must follow “Rule the Space” protocol
- PR content must drive toward civic visibility, not SEO
- Pop-ups never primary — focus on *signal loops* not *event planning*

---

## 🚨 Style Enforcement
- Bold POV over bland branding
- Replace “we’re excited” with “we’re building”
- Never request permission. Spotlight momentum.
