## 🧭 Why This Exists

PickleWhirl’s movement thrives on visibility — but visibility only matters if people can engage. This addendum equips content creators with language, structure, and formatting tools to make every post, caption, quote, and reel **readable, shareable, and actionable**.

> “If they can’t read it, they can’t join it.”

## ✍️ Plain English = Civic Clarity

To write with civic readability in mind:

- Use active voice and sentence case.
- Avoid ALL CAPS (harder to read, comes off aggressive).
- Keep sentences to the point (≤ 20 words).
- Eliminate jargon, slang, and clichés.
- Choose simple words over complicated ones (e.g. “use” instead of “utilize”).

> “Brevity helps readability.”

**Do:**  
✔ Write like you're explaining to a neighbor.  
✔ Use direct language that respects time and attention.

**Don’t:**  
✘ Assume everyone knows the lingo.  
✘ Bury meaning behind style.

## 🧱 Structural Tactics for Scannability

Readers *scan*, not study. Your layout should reflect that:

### ✅ Best Practices

- Break into short paragraphs (1 idea per paragraph).
- Use bullet points and subheadings.
- Highlight keywords (bold or hyperlink for web).
- Use meaningful subheadings (not clever or vague).

### 🧠 Use “The Inverted Pyramid”

> Start with the most important message. Add detail below.

**Example Flow:**  
**Headline** → Key Point → Context → Action or Transition

## 🖼️ Formatting for Carousels, Reels, and Captions

- Use one idea per slide or panel.  
- Use large, legible text and consistent spacing.  
- Final slide = CTA. Always.

**Reel Scripts:** Keep voiceovers conversational and tight. Punchy. No wall-of-text narration.

> Write for replay. Not for applause.

**Substack Formatting Tips:**  
- Start with a vivid moment (ZIP, player, temp, or quote).  
- Expand with story, insight, or stat.  
- Bold your civic truth.  
- End with one crisp CTA: Founding List, reply, or quote pull.  
- Keep paragraphs short. Use subheads to break up logic.
