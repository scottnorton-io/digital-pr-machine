# 📄 Addendum: Playbook Metrics – *KPI-Style Signal Tracking for Digital PR*

**Reference Code:** `addendum-playbook-metrics.md`  
**Purpose:** Define clear, non-vanity metrics to track the impact of PickleWhirl’s narrative-driven PR content across platforms, channels, and civic uses.

This is not social media “reporting.”  
It’s **signal intelligence** — proof that our story is landing where it matters.

## 🧠 What Counts As a “Signal”?

A signal is **any observable outcome** that shows:
- Traction with the right audience (players, cities, partners)
- Motion toward trust or credibility
- Content reuse or resharing across channels

## 🔁 Signal Loop Completion Checklist

Every PR asset should be evaluated with:

| Signal Component     | Question                                          | Goal               |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| **Engagement Loop**  | Did it earn a reply, vote, tag, or comment?      | >5 meaningful interactions |
| **Share Loop**       | Was it reposted or DM’d?                         | >2 shares or saves |
| **Proof Loop**       | Did it get quoted or reused in decks/emails?     | 1+ reuse instance  |
| **Whirl Loop**       | Did it trigger a new signup or Founding List mention? | 1+ downstream action |

If it hits 2+ loops, mark as **High Signal** and store in `/analytics/reuse-log.md`.

## 🧭 Traction Flag System

Flag content in `/analytics/reuse-log.md` using:

| Flag        | Meaning                                                  |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| ✅ `High Signal`   | Met 3+ loop tests or triggered civic reuse              |
| 🔁 `Remix Ready`   | Eligible for cross-posting or reformatting             |
| 🏛 `Civic Quote`   | Line is usable in city emails, decks, or public docs    |
| 📈 `Conversion Lead`| Directly drove sign-up, RSVP, or list join             |

Use these flags to prioritize reuse, highlight in briefings, or trigger “Build PR Package” commands.

## 📬 Weekly Summary Suggestions

Use these summaries to:

* Inform city meetings or investor updates
* Spot top-performing voice or format styles
* Trigger remix or spotlight strategy

**GPT Prompt:**

> “Summarize this week’s highest-signal content with links to assets, reuse logs, and downstream activity.”

---

## 💡 Metrics That Don’t Matter (Here)

These should not drive decisions unless paired with true signal:

* 💀 Follower count
* 💀 Likes without comment/save
* 💀 Reach without conversion
* 💀 Views without replay

> These are not momentum. They are mirrors.

---

## 🎯 Final Evaluation Philosophy

**Post success = proof of motion.**
Not applause. Not algorithms.

> “If it got quoted, reused, or sparked new hands on deck — that’s a win.”

Every signal is a brick in the story.
Track what builds.
