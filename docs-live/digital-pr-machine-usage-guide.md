# 🧠 **Digital PR Machine Usage Guide – v1.0 (2025-06-23)**

> *For crafting signal-first visibility loops that cities quote, communities share, and movements build on.*

---

## 🎯 What This Is

The **Digital PR Machine** is PickleWhirl’s civic visibility engine. It transforms *local truths* into *movement momentum* — with every caption, quote, reel, or remix feeding a larger proof loop.

**PR here doesn’t mean press.**
It means **public recognition**.
Proof of civic value, in motion.

---

## 🌀 Core Engine – Signal Loop Structure

```text
HOOK → BROADER TRUTH → LOCAL TIE-IN → WHIRL MOMENT → CIVIC INVITE
```

Use this flow in **every caption, script, quote, or carousel** unless otherwise noted.

## 🔁 Reuse Rules: The 1:3 Mandate

> If a post worked once, it must work **three more times** — across formats or audiences.

**Example:**

* Reel → Carousel + Quote + Email
* IG Caption → Civic Quote + Deck Line + LinkedIn Rewrite

**Storage Rules:**

* Quotes → `/scripts`
* IG Carousels → `/social-templates/IG/`
* LinkedIn → `/social-templates/LI/`
* Reels → `/tv-assets/social-clips/`
* Deck Inserts → `/crm-board`
* Email Snippets → `/email-drafts/`

---

## 🔖 Tag Every Asset With:

* `#HeatCheck` — climate urgency
* `#BuildTheCourts` — civic infrastructure
* `#IndoorWhy` — wellness, equity, access
* `#WhirlLocal` — player or zip-code spotlight
* `#BeginnerForever` — inclusion and culture
* `#ProofNotPitch` — civic or funder-facing proof

Run this checklist:

* [ ] Hook is strong and civic-ready?
* [ ] Tagged with appropriate loop (`#HeatCheck`, etc.)?
* [ ] One CTA only — no "follow us" fluff?
* [ ] Can it be quoted by a civic official?
* [ ] Is it remixable across at least 2 more formats?
* [ ] Stored in correct folder?

Every caption is a civic conversation starter.
Every reel is a funding deck preview.
Every remix is a proof loop.

Let them see it.
Let them share it.
Let them build with us.
