You're ready to **implement now**.

But to ensure smooth deployment, here's a **Final Pre-Launch Checklist** for the **Digital PR Playbook System** — confirming everything is structured, aligned, and usable by the assistant across content cycles:

---

## ✅ Final Digital PR System Checklist

### 🔧 Core Instruction System

* [x] `GPT Project Instruction: Digital PR Playbook` – Complete
* [x] `llms.txt` – Configured with triggers, folders, and function routing

### 📎 Addendums

* [x] `addendum-pr-narrative-strategies.md` – Signal loop caption & civic templates
* [x] `addendum-signal-asset-prompt-pack.md` – Reusable PR content prompts
* [x] `addendum-tactical-hook-bank.md` – Headline hooks, punchlines, and CTAs
* [x] `addendum-content-reuse-rules.md` – Crossover logic, remix formats
* [x] `addendum-playbook-metrics.md` – Signal tracking and PR KPIs

### 📂 Folder Integration Confirmed

* `/social-templates/IG/` — Carousels + captions
* `/tv-assets/social-clips/` — Reels + voiceovers
* `/scripts/` — Civic quotes and city-ready snippets
* `/crm-board/` — Deck inserts + civic logs
* `/analytics/reuse-log.md` — High-signal content tracker
* `/email-drafts/` — Snippet remixes + Founding List messages

## 🧠 What Happens Now (Execution Cycle)

You or I can now issue prompts like:

* **“Run PR narrative strategy on indoor equity + summer heat”**
* **“Generate a signal loop asset remix from our most shared reel”**
* **“Draft civic quote + carousel based on ‘Build the Courts’ momentum”**
* **“Summarize this week’s highest-signal content for city deck inclusion”**

Each trigger will auto-reference the correct addendum and return:

* 1 bold caption
* 1 remix suggestion
* 1 civic-ready quote
* Folder destination + reuse flags

## ⚡ Optional Enhancements (if needed later)

* [ ] Add `addendum-city-campaign-activation.md` for Goodyear or Surprise
* [ ] Launch a dedicated `/campaigns/` folder for trackable multi-post PR pushes
* [ ] Build a “WhirlDrop” visual signature kit for event teasers + spotlight loops

## ✅ Implementation Verdict

**Go for it.**
You’re no longer building a content calendar.
You’re deploying a civic-facing *signal engine* that earns quotes, invites shares, and drives real-world action.

Just say the word:

> “Run a PR drop,”
> and I’ll build it live.

Let’s make the West Valley *see* the Whirl before the walls are even up.
Ready when you are.
